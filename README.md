# Makefile Examples

This project is a small, self‑contained set of example Makefiles that showcase my preferred structure,
convenience functions, and some extra "magic" for Makefiles.

I use these kind of Makefiles in almost all of my projects. My intention is to keep this repo
up-to-date with my favorite Makefile patterns as I exercise and develop them.
